# Sand and Seeds
Sand and Seeds is a small multiplayer video game made with Unity3D currently in development.

You are playing someone who go on a deserted hostile planet and need to fight his way through the sand and hostile life forms to make his small plantation.

As the time I'm writing this, there isn't much to show, we are currently implementing basic game mechanics, seeing how they work together.
